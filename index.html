It began in 1973 as the Whitbread Round the World Race and since then has taken on many forms. The race is an around-the-clock battle to the finish line with teams sailing hundreds of thousands of miles to be within minutes of each other at the finish. The race is divided into multiple segments, or legs, that over a 9-month-long period, circumnavigate the globe. Each leg demonstrates new challenges and a new opportunity for any team to take the lead.</p><p class="lob-about-text-2">The crew onboard is constantly being pushed to their limits. They endure the blistering heat and the freezing cold and they can never give up. During the race, teams will rotate crew between sleeping and sailing to allow the boat to be sailed to its maximum potential around the clock. In the last race edition, the teams spent 126 days at sea.</p><p class="lob-about-text-3">The Ocean Race is preparing for its 46th edition which starts in Alicante, Spain, in autumn of 2022.</p></div></div><div class="lob-deck"><div class="lob-deck-opening"><video class="lob-deck-opening-video" width="600" height="400" autoplay loop muted><source src="images/Brunel deck on reach-.2f7e5fcc4bd1223e27815e088119d954.mp4" type="video/mp4"><source src="images/Brunel-deck-on-reach-.5f35597ca69a409c3c2fd1a6fb4192b8.webm" type="video/webm">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><h2 class="lob-deck-opening-header">Life on Deck</h2><div class="lob-deck-opening-text"><h4 class="lob-deck-opening-text-header">Life on Deck</h4><p class="lob-deck-opening-text-1">To be able to compete in a race like The Ocean Race, a sailor has to find a kind of comfort and serenity when sailing in the middle of nowhere, hundreds of miles from shore. Teams need to be filled with a crew that is not afraid of independence and detachment from other people. These teams sail in some of the most challenging and unforgiving waters on the planet, like the Southern Ocean, which is the Everest to ocean sailors. When conditions get tough and mistakes can be life-threatening, the crew needs to be able to work together to solve problems to be able to get to their finish line.</p><p class="lob-deck-opening-text-2">On deck, crew members work together to keep the boat moving fast. There are constantly jobs to be done from driving and adjusting sails to neatening lines. The crew is exposed to all the elements, from heat and sun to water freezing on the deck. They wear specially designed gear to help them stay comfortable. However, a huge part of sailing offshore is knowing how to keep yourself protected from the extreme elements.</p></div></div><div class="lob-deck-bow"><video class="lob-deck-bow-video" width="600" height="400" autoplay loop muted><source src="images/Brunel Bow work over wave-.91fd6c3cb44e9bc94bef1a1686e7382c.mp4" type="video/mp4"><source src="images/Brunel Bow work over wave-.9b856049bb438c01e44209af960af7c6.webm" type="video/webm">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><h3 class="lob-deck-bow-header">Life On Deck: On the Pointy End</h3><div class="lob-deck-bow-text"><h4 class="lob-deck-bow-text-header">Life On Deck: On the Pointy End</h4><p class="lob-deck-bow-text-1">The bowman is the crew member whose job it is to run the foredeck. They are in charge of everything forward of the mast, primarily sail changes, which happen often and keep them very busy. They have to be ready for anything and are constantly moving around the boat.</p><p class="lob-deck-bow-text-2">The bowman is the “monkey man” on board. They are the ones who get tasked with jobs like getting hoisted upwards of 100 feet to the top of the rig. They are sent up for various reasons, such as periodic rig checks, maintenance, and looking for wind on the horizon when things get light. Sometimes their job is demanding, but they get the best view at the top.</p></div><video class="lob-deck-bow-video-2" width="600" height="400" autoplay loop><source src="images/Top of Rig-.f41d4310ac79487f807ed947edf3129e.mp4" type="video/mp4"><source src="images/Top-of-Rig-.746ee94f58016d8ebfd4bb7e07abea40.webm" type="video/webm">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></div><div class="lob-deck-cockpit"><video class="lob-deck-cockpit-video" width="600" height="400" autoplay loop muted><source src="images/Akzonobel slowmode upcloose deck-.92f943fe0f46ec9c94b8b3b4a300e34c.mp4" type="video/mp4"><source src="images/Akzonobel-slowmode-upcloose-deck-.58d7c5de66f6a16fcc7a45ce29d3849a.webm" type="video/webm">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><h3 class="lob-deck-cockpit-header">Life On Deck: In the Cockpit</h3><div class="lob-deck-cockpit-text"><h4 class="lob-deck-cockpit-text-header">Life On Deck: In the Cockpit</h4><p class="lob-deck-cockpit-text-1">The rest of the crew works from the back of the boat in the cockpit. The crew is constantly on deck adjusting sails, organizing equipment, and driving the boat.</p><p class="lob-deck-cockpit-text-2">When it is time for a sail change, the bowman has their respective jobs forward of the mast, however, the whole crew is involved to make the process more efficient. When sails come down they get pulled back to the cockpit to get organized before storing down below. The sails are heavy and hard to move, so a lot of hands makes for easier work.</p></div><video class="lob-deck-cockpit-video-2" width="600" height="400" autoplay loop muted><source src="images/cockpit second.4281d046dc00206fec66ef8285882c4f.mp4" type="video/mp4"><source src="images/cockpit-second.b23d5344bd7808e04350ea7f9379ff6c.webm" type="video/webm">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></div></div><video class="lob-off-opening-video" width="600" height="400" autoplay loop muted><source src="images/Off watch- Below deck.-.0adc4c1c15889b5a1f97722487296771.mp4" type="video/mp4"><source src="images/Off-watch-Below-deck.-.be7faf3e0f3010fe3b631fa776ad6b82.webm" type="video/webm">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><div class="lob-off"><div class="lob-off-opeing"><h2 class="lob-off-opening-header">Life Below Deck</h2><h4 class="lob-off-opening-text-header">Life Below Deck</h4><p class="lob-off-opening-text-1">Down below is the crew's home. When the crew is relieved from their watch, they make their way down below and into a bunk for some much-needed shut-eye. At the same time, other people might be working on repairing sails or machinery, working at the navigation desk, cooking a meal, or bailing and cleaning the boat. Even through stormy seas, there is a very active scene under the decks.</p><p class="lob-off-opening-text-2">The boat has to carry a lot of gear. There is personal gear, safety gear, sails, spares, tools, and most importantly food. This creates an organized mess down below to the average eye, however, it is vital for the crew to know where everything is and to put things back into their respective places. The crew also gets very comfortable with limited personal space between themselves and the rest of the crew.</p></div><div class="lob-off-body"><video class="lob-off-body-video" width="600" height="400" autoplay loop muted><source src="images/Sleep one-.72b1616bc724ab242973e35977d32ddb.mp4" type="video/mp4"><source src="images/Sleep-one-.30aeeed1a27fbb2d36ea720bfa1d341b.webm" type="video/webm">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p class="lob-off-body-text">The most important activity happening down below is sleep. The crew is constantly being worked so they have to make the most of their time that is allotted for rest. Sometimes during your off-watch, there is an all-hands-on-deck or a stand-by call which means everyone needs to be ready to go. The crew learns fast to sleep where they can when they can.</p><video class="lob-off-body-video-2" width="600" height="400" autoplay loop muted><source src="images/Sleep 2-.a28afe81ac13b1c66c0ec36e27422a15.mp4" type="video/mp4"><source src="images/Sleep-2-.7a8a0da9201e0c8e59a290e37de6efda.webm" type="video/webm">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></div></div></section><script src="main.96f1395b5a91ac99f022.js"></script></body></html>
